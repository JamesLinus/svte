commits to mt should be small and frequent, push them as soon as possible, once something works bug free, push it. That way it is easier to track changes over a period of time


Todo/Goals:

vte callbacks
http regex
color schemes
rcfile 
font configuration
commenting and reworking some source.
minimal gtk or vte lib possible?


mt - multi-terminal: a simple, tabbed, VTE based terminal that aims to simple, flexible, and maintain a ridiculously small codebase. white the footprint may not be even close to st, i feel it provides better integration to the modern linux environment. GTK's footprint isn't light, but it has excellent API and features.

Basically another minimal GTK incarnation of gtk's VTE integration.

I was looking for a alternative to Sakura, Lilyterm and others. 


BUGS: Downsizing doesn't work,

GdkGeometry hints needed
