Todo/Goals:

create terminal. xD
tabbing
callbacks
stuff like that
color schemes
rcfile 

mt - multi-terminal: a simple, tabbed, VTE based terminal that aims to simple, flexible, and maintain a ridiculously small codebase

Basically another minimal GTK incarnation of gtk's VTE integration.

I was looking for a alternative to Sakura, but is tabbed and gtk based.


Bugs:


None
